Milan, Sept. 21, 1771.
I AM well, God be praised! I cant write much. 1st, I have nothing to say. 2d, my fingers
ache from writing. I often whistle an air, but no one responds. Only two arias of the
Serenata are still wanting, and then it will be finished. I have no longer any fancy for
Salzburg; I am afraid I might go mad too. Wolfgang
