My dear Friend, My few days stay at your fairy-like castle Itter in Tyrol will remain
a magic memory. When you have signed the Petersburg Conservatorium contract let
me know. You know, indeed, that I very much approve of this turn and fixing of your
brilliant artistic career. It requires no excessive obligations, and will be an advantage
to you. Friendly greetings to the New School from your faithful admirer and friend, F.
Liszt
Weimar, September 13th, 1884
I am here till the end of October. Later on I shall visit my friends Geza Zichy and Sandor
Teleky in Hungary.
