If you were here, my dear friend, you would perhaps find means to put into some sort
of order the hundreds of letters that rain upon me from everywhere. These bothers and
burdens of the amiability with which I am credited are becoming insupportable, and I
really long, some fine day, to cry from the housetops that I beg the public to consider
me as one of the most disagreeable, whimsical and disobliging of men. To our cordial
meeting at Weimar in the early days of April. Ever your very affectionate and grateful F.
